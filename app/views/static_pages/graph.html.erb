	  A <span class="italic">graph</span> is a abstract data type that is meant to implement the graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics.

	  A graph data structure is made of a finite set of nodes (or vertices), together with a set of orderd pairs of these nodes. These pairings are called edges or arcs. In math, an edge (x,y) is said to point or go from x to y. These nodes may be a part of the graph structure.
